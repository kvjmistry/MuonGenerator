Notes on how the coordinate systems match from Leslie's simulation to the nexus simulation


NEXUS:
x = 0 -> beta = 0 deg
z =0 -> beta = 90 deg
North -> beta = 140 deg
South -> beta = 320 deg
-
Leslie coordinate system:
x = 0 -> beta = 0
z = 0 -> beta = 270 deg
North -> beta = 220 deg
South -> beta = 40 deg
-
So nexus azimuth ("beta") spins in the opsite diretion to your beta.
-
To go from north to x = 0 we must rotate by -140 degrees if we are using nexus angles.
To go from x = 0 in Leslie Coordinate system to north in NEXUS system if we  must add 220 deg then swap the direction of beta.
